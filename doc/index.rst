RTC-Tools documentation
=======================

This is the documentation for RTC-Tools 2.0, the `Deltares <https://www.deltares.nl/>`_ toolbox for control and optimization of environmental systems.

Visit the `RTC-Tools website <https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/rtc-tools/>`_ for a general product description and information on available services.

This first chapter covers installation of the software.  The subsequent two chapters describe the RTC-Tools Python API.  The fourth and final chapter discusses several illustrative examples, including the use of goal programming for multi-objective optimization, as well as the use of forecast ensembles.
